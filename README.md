# NumPyNet
A fully-connected neural network built mainly in NumPy complemented by a digit classifying app.

### Neural Network Features

The network class is defined in the neural_net.py file and comes with several basic features.  
Aside from specifying the network architecture on instantiating, the class supports training, predicting, plotting loss, evaluating the accuracy as well as saving and loading models.


### MNIST App

As a means to displaying the capacity of the model, the mnist_ui.py file contains a script for a pygame app on which the user can draw a digit and ask the classifier to predict its value. This also comes with an estimation of the model's confidence in its prediction.
